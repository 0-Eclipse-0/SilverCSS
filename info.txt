SilverCSS is a homemade CSS library that makes a CSS developer's life easier. Started on 6/12/2015 by
Matthew Hambrecht, SilverCSS was made to limit the need to actually code in CSS of course. Hence the name "SilverCSS."
SilverCSS is open-source but permission is needed before it can be re distributed.

Disclaimer: SilverCSS isn't going to allow you to do everything you'd like to do as there are a few things you have to
setup on your own. Don't get mad at the Developer team when you don't know CSS and can't reach the full aesthetic potential
of your website.

Things you'll need to use SilverCSS to the greatest extent:
-Knowledge of HTML
-Previous Knowledge of Basic CSS
-SilverCSS files downloaded
-An Integrated Development Environment or a Text Editor
-Patience
-Time

Things SilverCSS can't do:
-Colors
-Grids
